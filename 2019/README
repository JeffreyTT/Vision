# Vision4915/solution

## applications

* `runPiCam.py` - primary entrypoint when running in competition (no server currently).
  To get the highest framerate, we run the frame-capture in a separate thread from the
  algorithm.
* `picamStreamer.py` - mjpg streaming on port 5080... URL controls whether we stream
  the results of an algorithm or direct stream.  http://{host}:{port}/{algo}.mjpg (or mjpeg).

  * algo: "direct" - direct/fast video streaming
  * algo: "empty" - per-frame streaming, no processing
  * algo: "hsv" - show hsv of camera view
  * algo: anythingelse - the "default" algo 
  # add more named algos as desired


## library

* `algo.py` - abstraction for current vision algorithm
* `picam.py` - thin vaneer atop PiCamera 
* `comm.py` - manage communication with robot via networktables

## support

* vision4915.service - installing a python script as a service requires
    _daemonization_, which is part of the support in runPiCam.
* in 2019, we can likely install our script via the FRCVision bootstrapping
  process.
