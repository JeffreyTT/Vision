# Intro

This is a slightly modified clone of the original h264-live-player
repo.  The primary goal here was to achieve more robust connect/disconnect
behavior for a client as with the driver station in an frc match.

This package requires nodejs and has been tested with version 10.X.

The primary use-case is the raspberry pi server.
